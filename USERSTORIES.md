1. As a user I can add an amenity to the database, specifying:
    - name (required)
    - type (tennis court, football/basketball/volleyball field, etc) (required)
    - location (latitude, longitude) (required)
    - description 
    - photo
2. As a user I can add photos to an existing amenity
3. As a user I can search amenities in a given area, potentially filtering by type
4. As a user I can identify an amenity by photo and location (both are required)
5. As a user I can see amenity's schedule
6. As a user I can reserve an amenity for a time everybody else deems sensible (e.g
 1 hor for a tennis court is enough, but not enough for a volleyball or basketball match)
7. As a user I must be sure, that reservation disputes are resolved in a fair manner by
the system (decide later on resolution algorithm)
